MILD LEMON README üçã
Important Setup Instructions (Seriously, Read This!)
First of all, congratulations! You've just downloaded Mild Lemon, the ultimate (totally legitimate) hacking simulator that‚Äôs so good, even your antivirus thinks it‚Äôs too awesome to handle. Let‚Äôs walk you through the steps to get it working, because, let‚Äôs face it, your computer probably thinks this is a virus. Spoiler alert: It‚Äôs not! (We promise... kind of).
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Step 1: Turn Off Your Antivirus Protection
Okay, let‚Äôs get this out of the way. Your antivirus is going to throw a tantrum the moment you try to run this masterpiece. Why? Because it doesn‚Äôt understand the concept of "hacking." So, before you do anything else:

Open your antivirus software.
Find the "Turn off protection" or "Disable real-time scanning" button.
Click it, and don‚Äôt worry-you can always turn it back on later. Unless you're feeling adventurous... üëÄ
Why do I need to do this?
Because antiviruses are overly sensitive, and they think anything with "hacking tools" is evil. Mild Lemon is here to prove them wrong. Relax, we‚Äôre not after your bank details. (Or are we?)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Step 4: Run It From Your Desktop
To ensure everything works properly, we highly recommend dragging the Mild Lemon folder to your Desktop before running it. This guarantees a fully functional experience with no unexpected issues.

Here‚Äôs what to do:
Locate the folder where you saved the Mild Lemon files.
Drag the entire folder to your Desktop.
Open it and double-click the .bat file to get things running. üçã
Important:
You might notice a file called MildLime.exe. Ignore it.
Seriously, don‚Äôt touch it, open it, or try to figure out what it does. It‚Äôs part of the magic behind the scenes, and messing with it might ruin the experience.

Why follow these steps?
Running Mild Lemon from random locations can cause errors or path issues. Keeping it on the Desktop ensures everything runs as intended without a hitch.

Pro Tip: If you skip this step and something breaks, well, don‚Äôt say we didn‚Äôt warn you!
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Now, let‚Äôs address the million-dollar question:

‚ÄúWhy do you have so many layers?‚Äù

Great question, my friend. And here‚Äôs the answer:
Antivirus paranoia. Layers upon layers confuse those nosy antivirus programs, making them think, "Hmm, this might be harmless after all." It‚Äôs like sneaking a wolf into a sheep costume‚Ä¶ or a lemon into a lime costume. üçã

For you: Don‚Äôt worry about the layers. They‚Äôre like the onion of Mild Lemon. Peel back as many as you want; it‚Äôs safe.

Final Notes
This is all a joke, okay? The "hacking tools" are Real and purely for fun Or Ethical Hacking. Mild Lemon won‚Äôt actually hack Someone without their Consent (unless your sense of humor counts).
If you see a FBI warning, don‚Äôt call the cops Even tho that joke Wasnt Funny What the Fuck. That‚Äôs just part of the fun.
Remember, when life gives you lemons, make hacking Programms. üçã
Now, stop reading and start Hacking Boi! Oh, and don‚Äôt forget to turn off your antivirus‚Ä¶ üòè
